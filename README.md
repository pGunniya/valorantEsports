# valorantEsports

This project is a collection of the code, graphs and analyses that i've created while trying to answer some questions about the video game "Valorant", developed by Riot Games, and it's esports domain. 

I've added a short description (question being answered, analysis methods used, conclusion, other thoughts) for each file
